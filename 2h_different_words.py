#Find different words from a given plain text without any space by comparing
#this text with a given corpus of words. Also find the score of words.

#Question:
#Initialize the hash tag test data or URL test data and convert to plain text without any
#space.. Read a text file of different words and compare the plain text data with the
#words exist in that text file and find out different words available in that plain text. Also
#find out how many words could be found. (for example, text = "#whatismyname" or
#text = www.whatismyname.com. Convert that to plain text without space as:
#whatismyname and read text file as words.txt. Now compare plain text with words
#given in a file and find the words form the plain text and the count of words which
#could be found)
